# I Choose Who v2

A successor to the original [I Choose Who](https://github.com/mdbow22/I-Choose-Who) app that I made in my coding bootcamp. Create a personal collection of pokemon you have in your games. Then go to the Battle Planner, select the pokemon you're going up against, and I-Choose-Who will determine the best pokemon in your collection for the job.

## Differences from the Original

Original App was built on the following:
- Express API
- Handlebars template engine
- Sequelize ORM
- MySQL Database
- Bulma CSS

V2 is now built with the following:
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL

Other changes include a switch from express-sessions for authentication to Next-Auth, deployment to Railway instead of Heroku, and an overhaul of the algorithm used in the Battle Planner.

## Functionality

After logging in, users can add any pokemon from Generations I-VII (Gen VIII coming soon!) to their personal Pok√©dex. Once they do, they can use the battle planner to determine which of their pokemon is best suited for battle based on their typing.


## Demo Site

You can access the demo site here: [i-choose-who.up.railway.app](https://i-choose-who.up.railway.app)

An email is required to access and the use the site but this is only stored on the server for the app and is not used for any analytics.
