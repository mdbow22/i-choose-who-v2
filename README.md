# I Choose Who v2

A successor to the original I Choose Who app that I made in my coding bootcamp.

## Differences from the Original

The original app was built with an Express API, using handlebars as a template engine for creating the front-end and Sequelize as the ORM for the MySQL Database. This definitely got the job done, but I wanted to showcase the site with a more modern front-end. V2 is rebuilt from the ground up with NextJS, Prisma ORM, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Authentication has switched from express-sessions to Next-Auth as well. I have also chosen to deploy v2 on Railway instead of Heroku, and use a Railway postgreSQL database instead of mySQL.

In addition, the algorithm for creating battle recommendations has been completely rewritten for better performance.

## Functionality

After logging in, users can add any pokemon from Generations I-VII (Gen VIII coming soon!) to their personal Pok√©dex. Once they do, they can use the battle planner to determine which of their pokemon is best suited for battle based on their typing.
